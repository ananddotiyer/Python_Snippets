      "\"utf8\": \"Hello.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Welcome to Statistics for Data Science-1.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"I am Usha Mohan, Professor at the Department\\nof Management Studies, IIT Madras.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Over the next 12 weeks, we would travel together\\nto understand the basics of statistics that\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"is needed for your online degree programme.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, we first begin with understanding what\\nis statistics.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, first we look at what is the definition\\nof statistics.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, one of the most popular definitions of\\nstatistics tells us statistics is the art\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"of learning from data which includes collection\\nof data, analysis of data, presentation of\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"data, and then, drawing conclusions from data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, one of the main things you are going to\\nlearn in this course is to first, we are going\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"to look at how you collect data So, that is\\none of the main things which we will do.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, we start with data collection.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, we look at how you collect data and then,\\nwe go on to see how you actually present this\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"During this course, we learn about how you\\ndo present data in a tabular form; we introduce\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"a concepts of frequency tables; we introduce\\na concept of relative frequency and we look\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"at how you tabulate data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"We also learn about the different types of\\ndata that you encounter.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Then, we look at how you further look at describing\\ndata using graphical techniques.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Some of the graphical techniques that you\\nwould learn are bar charts, pie charts, histograms,\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"stem leaf plots etcetera.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"We then, also go about learning how you actually\\ncome up with numerical measures of data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"What we look here mainly is at the measures\\nof central tendency; namely, mean, median\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"and mode and the measures of variation; namely,\\nrange, variance, standard deviation.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, far we have just talked about describing\\na single variable, we also look at answering\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"questions about association between variables.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Towards this, we also introduce the concept\\nof contingency tables, scatter plots and we\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"also introduce what is a correlation matrix.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, predominantly in the descriptive statistics\\nmodule, you will be learning about collecting\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"data, organising data and describing data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Describing data both using graphical techniques\\nand numerical techniques.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Now, once you are comfortable with just describing\\ndata, where the question is you just want\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"to describe whatever data you have.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"The next step is to try and see I said that\\nstatistics is the art of using data to draw\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"conclusions.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, you want to infer something from data.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, this lays the playground for you to go\\nnext level which is inferential statistics.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Inferential statistics will be taught in the\\nnext course on statistics.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"But, however, in this course, we will help\\nyou by laying the foundation or the building\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"block to understand inferential statistics.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"What do I mean by building block to understand\\ninferential statistics?\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"We motivate this through a small introduction\\nto the probability theory.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"When we go to probability theory, we start\\nby what we mean by permutation and combinations.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"This is something which you are going to revisit.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Most of you would have learned this in high\\nschool, but you are going to revisit the concept\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"of permutation and combinations.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Then, we introduce the notion of probability\\nthrough random experiments like rolling a\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"die, tossing a coin and then, afterwards we\\ntalk about probability of events, the combination\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"of events and why they are necessary.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Finally, we end this course by introducing\\nto two main distributions; namely, the binomial\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"distribution and the normal distribution.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Throughout the course, the focus is going\\nto be on teaching at a conceptual level and\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"applying these concepts to real world problems.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"So, you will have a lot of assignments which\\nwill test your knowledge, both at a conceptual\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"level and an application level.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"There would be at every stage, we will try\\nand motivate the learner to look at understanding\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"the concepts and applying their concepts through\\na set of case studies specifically designed\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"for this course.\"\n",
      "\"utf8\": \"Welcome again to the world of statistics and\\nthis course which is Statistics for Data Science-1.\"\n"
