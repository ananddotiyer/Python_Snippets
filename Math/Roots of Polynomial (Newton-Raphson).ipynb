    "Newton’s Method(also known as the Newton-Raphson method) is a successive approximation method for finding the roots of a function. Recall that the roots of a function f(x) are the values of x such that f(x) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.We guess some x0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.We check to see if it’s a root or close enough to a root by calculating f(x0). If f(x0) is within some small value epsilon of 0, we say that’s good enough and call x0 a root.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.If f(x0) is not good enough, we need to come up with a better guess, x1. x1 is calculated by the equation: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.We check to see if x1 is close enough to a root. If it is not, we make a better guess x2 and check that. And so on and so on. For every xn that is not close enough to a root, we replace it with xn+1 = xn - f(xn)/f'(xn) and check if that’s close enough to a root. We repeat until we finally find a value close to a root."
